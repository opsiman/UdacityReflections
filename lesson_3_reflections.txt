3.1 When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I were working on the file from more than one computer. 
If I want a remote backup of my project. 
If more than one person is working on the project. 
This is going to come in very handy since I seem to find myself working 
on 3 different computers throughout any given day.
