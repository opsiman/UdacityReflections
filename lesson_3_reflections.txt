3.1 When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I were working on the file from more than one computer. 
If I want a remote backup of my project. 
If more than one person is working on the project. 
This is going to come in very handy since I seem to find myself working 
on 3 different computers throughout any given day.



3.2 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

First thought is that you don't necessarily get to a good stopping point with every commit-- 
and neither does another coder working on the project. 
You probably don't need to chase every commit as it comes.
I'm not sure how you'd know when to pull though, 
when other coders are working on the same project.
